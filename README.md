# Automating text-based CAPTCHAs with Deep Learning models

With companies allocating more and more of their business to online platforms, the need for a strong security is now more prevalent than ever. Malicious entities look to harm companies can use a range of attacks to disrupt the flow of commerce, for example by launching thousands of requests to the companies platform in an attempt to exceed its capabilities and thus shutting the platform down, also known as a DDOS attack, or by swarming their platforms with bots which spread misinformation and are disruptive in general. To counteract this security issue, researchers have found a method to tell requests by bots and humans apart. This method is called CAPTCHA, short for Completely Automated Public Turing Tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart. 

For the masters course Pattern Recognition, we will implement a deep learning neural network to recognize and automate the acceptance process of text-based CAPTCHAs.
